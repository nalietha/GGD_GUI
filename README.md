# GGD_Streamer LED System

A Raspberry Pi-powered LED lighting display synchronized with internet streamers with a focus on Twitch but support for other more, risqu√©, content. Each LED node can be individually configured with display modes and effects.

## Features

- Real-time Twitch stream monitoring
- Optional checks for adult content presence (via public APIs)
- Per-node display configuration (color, effect, mode)
- Streamer-independent display mode (no internet required)
- Integrated .NET Web UI for color/effect configuration
- SignalR-based push updates to clients
- WS2811 LED support using GPIO on Raspberry Pi

## Showcase
### üîß Custom LED Nodes

Each node is built using WS2811-compatible RGB LEDs using DYImall 7LED Jewels, allowing for granular control and unique display modes per streamer or independent effect.
Any addressable LED light will work for this, my custom nodes were built with a halleffect sensor input for a magetically activated led effect. which has not be implemented in this version of the GGD stand

### üñºÔ∏è Display Stand

The display is mounted in a handcrafted stand with 16 neatly spaced node slots, cable management, and access to Raspberry Pi ports for power and debugging.

### üéá Live Demo

Watch the lights pulse to life when streamer mode is enabled.

## Project Structure

- **GGD_Display**: ASP.NET Core web interface to configure node settings, colors, and linked streamers.
- **TwitchAPI.dll**: Class library for fetching Twitch streamer status.
- **led_controller.py**: Python script running on Raspberry Pi to control WS2811 LEDs via GPIO.
- **save.json**: Stores persistent configuration for streamers and node mappings.

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Gen4/Zero2 or above (any model with GPIO support)
- Due to ARM7L support for .Net
- Python Flask will support older models.
- WS2811-compatible LED strip
- Power supply for LEDs
